infinality.d/README

Each file in this directory is a fontconfig configuration file. Fontconfig
scans this directory, loading all files of the form [0-9][0-9]*.conf.
These files are normally installed in /usr/share/fontconfig/infinality.avail/
and then symlinked here, allowing them to be easily installed and then
enabled/disabled by adjusting the symlinks.

The files are loaded in numeric order, the structure of the configuration
has led to the following conventions in usage:

 Files begining with:	  Contain:
 
 00 through 09		        Font directories
 10 through 19		        system rendering defaults (AA, etc)
 20 through 29		        font rendering options
 30 through 39		        family substitution
 40 through 49		        generic identification, map family->generic
 50 through 59		        alternate config file loading
 60 through 69		        generic aliases, map generic->family
 70 through 79		        select font (adjust which fonts are available)
 80 through 89		        match target="scan" (modify scanned patterns)
 90 through 99		        font synthesis

Besides, there are more subdirectories located in the main template directory,
each containing collection-specific fontconfig configuration files, that we
call "presets":

 /usr/share/fontconfig/infinality.avail/free
           for the free font collection (enabled by default)

 /usr/share/fontconfig/infinality.avail/ms
           for the proprietary font collection available with Microsoft Windows
           and Office software (not freely available)

 /etc/fonts/infinality.avail/combi
           for a custom, user-compiled collection

Symbolic links in infinality.d/ to all five *.conf files from one of the
presets need to be created in order for default aliases and font substitution
rules to work properly. The 'free' profile is enabled by default, but you can
use the command "fc-presets set" (as root) to change the profile (it's the
preferred method of changing presets, as it will take care of possible
conflicts with other symlinks already present).
