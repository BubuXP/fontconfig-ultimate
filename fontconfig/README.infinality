infinality.d/README

If you are using fontconfig-infinality-ultimate from the infinality-deb
github repo, templates are located in /usr/share/fontconfig/infinality.avail
and they are symlinked here instead. Besides, there are three more
subdirectories located in the main template directory, each containing
collection-specific fontconfig configuration files:

 /usr/share/fontconfig/infinality.avail/free
           for the free font collection (default)

 /usr/share/fontconfig/infinality.avail/ms
           for the proprietary font collection available with Microsoft Windows
           and Office software (not freely available)

 /etc/fonts/infinality.avail/combi
           for a custom, user-compiled collection

Symbolic links in infinality.d/ to all five *.conf files from one of either
'combi', 'free' or 'ms' need to be created in order for default aliases and
font substitution rules to work properly. The 'free' profile is enabled by
default, but you can use the command "fc-presets set" (as root) to change the
profile.
