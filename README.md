#### Quick installation instructions

**I. If you are an Arch Linux user, or if you are using one of the Arch Linux derivatives,** you may want to use pre-compiled packages from the `[infinality-bundle]` repository bohoomil maintain. This is a recommended approach in a majority of cases as it gives access to the entire functionality offered by Infinality patches and the ultimate configuration without a typical post installation routine.

For more information, see:

* [Infinality-bundle+fonts](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality-bundle+fonts) (install notes, troubleshooting)
* [infinality-bundle: good looking fonts made (even) easier](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=162098) (official infinality-bundle support thread for Arch Linux users)
* [infinality-bundle-fonts: a free multilingual font collection for Arch](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=170976) (official infinality-bundle-fonts support thread)

**II. If you are using Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives,** you can install the precompiled packages from $URL or, if the packages are incompatible, you can rebuild them for your distro version by yourself, using the deb sources.

**III. If you are using any other Linux distribution,** you can use all available resources here or in the original bohoomil github to rebuild the `fontconfig-infinality` package available in your distribution.



#### Further customization and misc options

* Many changes to the global `fontconfig-infinality` settings can be introduced on a per-user ground in a local `$HOME/.config/fontconfig` directory. Please, consult `/usr/share/doc/fontconfig-infinality/` for examples and templates you will need to start tweaking.

* At the moment, there are two font collections supported by `fontconfig-infinality` out of the box: a free one (activated by default, installed by dependencies of the `fontconfig-infinality` package), and a proprietary one (Microsoft's fonts supplied with MS Windows and MS Office). If you want to switch between them, use `fc-presets` script. There is also a `custom` preset available for highly customized font collections. Configuration files for the customizable presets are located in `/etc/fonts/infinality.avail/`.

* If you are using a desktop environment (KDE, GNOME, etc.) that lets you adjust font settings on its own, you should duplicate the base values as found in `/etc/X11/Xsession/99infinality-settings`, and they are:
   Antialias:  1 (enabled)
    Autohint:  0 (disabled)
         DPI:  96
     Hinting:  1 (enabled)
  Hint style:  hintfull (full)
  LCD filter:  lcddefault (default)
   Sub-pixel:  rgb
