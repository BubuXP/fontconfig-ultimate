#### Font configuration files, patches, scripts and source packages for Debian and derived distros (Infinality & friends)

Project website: [bohoomil.com](http://bohoomil.com "bohoomil.com")

#### Quick installation instructions

**I. If you are using Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives,** you can try installing the precompiled packages from my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7AdLMiZn4FzdGZNV2FpLWhPTkk) or, if the packages are incompatible, you can rebuild them for your distro version by yourself, using the deb sources there (soon will be ported here).

**II. If you are an Arch Linux user, or if you are using one of the Arch Linux derivatives,** go to the project homepage or [in the original GitHub page](https://github.com/bohoomil/fontconfig-ultimate) for more informations.

**III. If you are using any other Linux distribution,** you can use all available resources you can found here or [in the original GitHub page](https://github.com/bohoomil/fontconfig-ultimate) to rebuild a modified `fontconfig` package, or making a new `fontconfig-infinality` that could work without modifying your distro's original `fontconfig` package.



#### Further customization and misc options

* Many changes to the global `fontconfig-infinality` settings can be introduced on a per-user ground in a local `$HOME/.config/fontconfig` directory. Please, consult `/usr/share/doc/fontconfig-infinality/` for examples and templates you will need to start tweaking.

* At the moment, there are two font collections supported by `fontconfig-infinality` out of the box: a free one (activated by default, installed by dependencies of the `fontconfig-infinality` package), and a proprietary one (Microsoft's fonts supplied with MS Windows and MS Office). If you want to switch between them, use `fc-presets` script. There is also a `custom` preset available for highly customized font collections. Configuration files for the customizable presets are located in `/etc/fonts/infinality.avail/`.

* If you are using a desktop environment (KDE, GNOME, etc.) that lets you adjust font settings on its own, you should duplicate the base values as found in `/etc/X11/Xsession/99infinality-settings`, and they are:
   Antialias:  1 (enabled)
    Autohint:  0 (disabled)
         DPI:  96
     Hinting:  1 (enabled)
  Hint style:  hintfull (full)
  LCD filter:  lcddefault (default)
   Sub-pixel:  rgb
